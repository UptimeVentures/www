I've thought a lot, probably too much, about what it feels like begin a new project. When fueled by passion, the spark of inspiration can grow quickly into a roaring fire. Those moments are often unforgettable, but it's critical to remember what matters most is the work ahead. Inspiration is a pointless, momentary high unless you follow though.

Last year, after much deliberation, my family and I decided to move west, trading the expansive Chicagoland metro for the smaller (but rapidly expanding) Denver, Colorado. What I expected was to simply move my existing consultancy, Until Now, across state lines. Operations, I assumed, would remain essentially unchanged. We would continue work as a client services company, delivering React and JavaScript expertise to anyone who needed it. I would buckle down, launch our first real website, and procure a stable of local clients.

I was [following though on the goals](https://www.nicholaswyoung.com/2016/01/be-kind-rewind/) laid out in early 2016 when I recommitted to work as a full-time consultant. Or so I thought.

## Reinvention

Within six months of moving, my personal life changed drastically as the genetic condition I've battled daily finally [caught up with me,](https://www.nicholaswyoung.com/tags/chronic-illness/) creating symptoms I could no longer ignore. Instead of pouring energy into finding customers and re-launching my consultancy in a new city, I was searching for doctors instead. It wasn't long before the hours required to operate as a one-man client-services agency became too much.

I stopped talking about projects in public because I didn't know when, or if, I could finish them.

Now in 2017, my recovery is well underway, but the lessons I learned while trying to handle client requests and manage a grueling medical schedule have taught me much. In fact, they're baked into our [founding mission](/mission/) here at Uptime Ventures. These ideals are evident in our focus on internal projects, honing skills and products for small communities through continuous delivery before releasing our ideas into the wider world.

While the expertise I've developed over years of consulting on diverse hardware systems running a plethora of languages will certainly be available to our clients, Uptime Ventures' main focus will be to find and exploit markets where applied technology can be maximally effective, choosing instead to operate as a trusted partner rather than a purely contract development team.

Whether it's the mountain air, open skies, or something altogether unrelated; like others who came before me, I feel encouraged to dream bigger in the west.

## A Different Kind of Consultancy

During the darkest period of recovery, I began reading the works of noted futurist Ray Kurzweil. I assumed that futurism, if anything, would offer hope and intellectual stimulation to my otherwise bored and depressed mind. I was right, though the ideas which sprang from my reading were unexpected to say the least.

In [*The Singularity is Near: When Humans Transcend Biology*][singularity], Kurzweil observes that, "Most short range forecasts of what is technically feasible in future time periods dramatically underestimate the power of future developments." In other words, because the greatest technological developments occurred in our relatively recent past, we tend to think the pace of innovation has always remained steady. In reality, history is full of many periods of intellectual stagnation. Kurzweil's work stands in stark relief, as he chooses to focus on what is referred to as the "[historical epxponential][he]," view of innovation, which plots major technological accomplishments within a comparatively recent, accelerated timeline. 

Viewing modern history from Kurzweil's perspective, it becomes obvious we are living in a [period of unprecidented innovation, beginning in the year 1900 and extending into the distant future.](http://www.kurzweilai.net/the-law-of-accelerating-returns)

A core tenet of our mission at Uptime Ventures is that how and where technology is implemented is perhaps more important than the technology itself. With this purpose, I've created an agency designed to serve future needs. This belief also leads us to be a decisively multi-disciplinary firm; one that seems to seemlessly pair technical know-how with cultural awareness, thereby allowing us to safely explore the future of tech when combined with concepts from the arenas of medical, science, and artificial intellence.

In the following weeks, I'll continue sharing more of the Uptime Ventures story, including projects that are being designed and built in-house, and also the open source work that has been contributed under the company banner. I hope you'll join me by subscribing via [RSS](/blog/rss.xml) or email. If you're so inclined, you can also follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/UptimeVentures), or like [Uptime Ventures on Facebook.](https://facebook.com/UptimeVentures)

I'm excited about where this journey will lead, even though I don't know the way. The software industry has undergone many changes before now, and I sense that it will soon change again. Hopefully, that shift will carry us towards a brighter, more diverse future, of which Uptime Ventures intends to be a part.
