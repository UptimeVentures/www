As of this post, Uptime Ventures, LLC is legally dissolved.

If you live in the Denver area, you probably know me, the person who is penning this blog post. I'm [Nicholas Young, the one-man engineering team behind the company facade][personal]. For the last three years, I've worked on refining development tools and now, the ecosystems I contributed to are stabilizing. I'd like to begin *using* the tools, where in the past I've only *built* them.

To fulfill that goal, I've agreed to join a local company as a Senior Engineer, tasked with expanding their use of Rust.

During my time at Uptime Ventures, I became a maintainer of [Gatsby][gatsby], a React-based website generator and authored several [core][gatsby-feed] [plugins][gatsby-sitemap] that are collectively downloaded over 100,000 times per week; accelerated the development of Rust's `async` networking ecosystem as a member of the associated working group; made significant improvements to [Gotham, a Rust web framework][gotham]; and finally, helped plan and present [Colorado's first Rust conference][gr].

I'm proud of the work I've done under the Uptime Ventures name, and look forward to developing the future with my new coworkers.
