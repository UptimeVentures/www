The official website of Denver-based digital consultancy [Uptime
Ventures](https://www.uptime.ventures).

## Is this site "open source"?

The source is available, as you've probably noted. However, the source code (in
addition to articles, images and other content within this repo) isn't "open" as
you might expect.

Our team has decided to publish the source code to uptime.ventures for one
simple reason: education. As sites and applications built for the web grow in
complexity, new developers will need on-ramps to speed their access to
education. Opening our site's source code is one effort towards that end.

**Republishing articles (either whole or in-part) or displaying the Uptime
Ventures logo without permission is explicitly prohibited.** Linking is cool,
but please don't steal.

## Getting Started

To begin, install all dependencies like usual. This project is preconfigured to use `npm`, so you'll install dependencies by running `npm install`.

Once installation is complete, `npm run start` will launch a development server on [`localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000).

## Building for Production

When you're finished editing, `npm run build` will compile source files `src/`, combined with content from source directories (above) and output the built site in `public/`.

This site is automatically built by Netlify. Take a look at `package.json` and `netlify.toml` for details.
