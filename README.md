This repo contains the website assets for
[uptime.ventures](https://www.uptime.ventures).

### Getting Started

To begin, install all dependencies like usual. This project is configured to use `yarn` by default. `npm`, wonderful as it is, doesn't cooperate with Gatsby all that well.

Once installation is complete, `yarn start` will launch a development server on [`localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000).

### Building for Production

When you're finished editing, `yarn build` will compile source files `src/`, combined with content from source directories (above) and output the built site in `public/`.

This site is automatically built by Netlify. Take a look at `package.json` and `netlify.toml` for details.
